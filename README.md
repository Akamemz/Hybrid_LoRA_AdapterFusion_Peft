# Hybrid_LoRA-Data-Centric_Improvements

Combine LoRA variants (LoRA/QLoRA/GoRA) with data augmentation or curriculum learning for low-resource datasets. Contribution: Show that data-efficient LoRA improves performance without adding model parameters. Novelty: “LoRA + Data Quality” hasn’t been deeply explored yet.
